# Store Project

Take a look [here](https://fakestore-theta.vercel.app/)

Made with:
  - React
  - React Router
  - Vite
  - Tailwind
  - i18n
  
Resources from: 
  - fakeStore API

With this project i've used the opportunity to add new react knowledge, i've used for first time React Context to manage the global state of the shopping bag.
I've decided to use Tailwind since i like the quickness it gives at the time of building a small project like this one!
I've also gave it a shot to i18n and applied some translations to the navBar (I'd like to make a full translated page on my next projects)
